# # 1. Recursion

# # Exercise 1: Factorial using Recursion
# # Write a recursive function that takes a number n and returns the factorial of n.
# #  The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or 
# # equal to n (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).

# # Write a recursive function that returns the nth Fibonacci number.
# #  The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

# # Fibonacci(0) = 0
# # Fibonacci(1) = 1
# # Fibonacci(n) = Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2) for n > 1





# # Exercise 3: Sum of Digits using Recursion
# # Write a recursive function that computes the sum of the digits of a given number.
# #  For example, given n = 123, the function should return 6 (since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6).

# # 3. Sorting Algorithms

# # Exercise 1: Bubble Sort
# # Write a function that implements the bubble sort algorithm. Given a list of integers, 
# # the function should sort the list in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent 
# # elements if they are in the wrong order.

# # Exercise 2: Insertion Sort
# # Write a function that implements the insertion sort algorithm. Given a list of integers,
# #  the function should sort the list by inserting elements into their correct positions.

# # Exercise 3: Merge Sort (Recursive)
# # Write a function that implements the merge sort algorithm using recursion.
# # Given a list of integers, the function should divide the list into two halves, 
# # sort each half recursively, and then merge the sorted halves to produce a sorted list.
